Recall that break exits the loop entirely when its condition is met - ignoring all subsequent iterations.

continue statement:

The continue statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and move on to the next iteration.
It is often used to skip specific iterations based on a certain condition without exiting the entire loop.
Example of using continue in a for loop:

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  if (i === 2) {
    continue;
  }
  console.log(i);
}

// Solution as follows


function printNumbers(n) {
  for(var i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    if (i === n) {
        continue;
    }
    console.log(i);
   }
}

function solve(n) {
 printNumbers(n);
}
