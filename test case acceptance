Task
Lets write a program in the IDE which performs the following

The 1st line of input is an integer 
�
t - the count of test cases
Each test case consists of 2 lines of input
The 1st line of input has 2 space separated integers - accept them as variables 
�
A and 
�
B
The 2nd line of input has 3 space separated integers - accept them as variables 
�
C, 
�
D and 
�
E
For each test case - output all integers on a single line


// your code goes here
process.stdin.setEncoding('utf8');
process.stdin.on('data',function(input){
    const testCaseCount= input.trim().split('\n');
    const tcase= testCaseCount[0];
    
    for(let i=1;i<=2*tcase;i+=2)
    {
        console.log(testCaseCount[i]+" "+testCaseCount[i+1])
    }
})
